# How does coding (specifically R) help me as a researcher?

Most scientific research relies on numeric data.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.2em}
\item Data organisation
\item Statistical analysis
\item Visualisation
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2mm}\pause

Software exists that can do the above without code.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.2em}
\item \href{www.jmp.com}{JMP}
\item \href{https://www.minitab.com/en-us/products/minitab/?utm_campaign=BFO+-+US+-+EN&utm_medium=ppc&utm_term=minitab&utm_source=adwords&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_mt=e&hsa_ver=3&hsa_grp=75045421894&hsa_ad=381051763423&hsa_tgt=kwd-298703240867&hsa_cam=2063260456&hsa_acc=4841564033&hsa_src=g&hsa_kw=minitab&gclid=Cj0KCQiAqNPyBRCjARIsAKA-WFzHJH4aiDsh90CMsg3rYeLEQGeeYBSDui1ZNZjBU2624YCsei5yhnEaAu7lEALw_wcB}{Minitab}

# How does coding (specifically R) help me as a researcher?

Practical advantages of learning and using R

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item R software is entirely free and open source \pause
\item Thousands \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html}{R packages} for specific data needs \pause
\item Standard programming language for statistics \pause
\item Write \href{https://stirlingcodingclub.github.io/Manuscripts_in_Rmarkdown/Rmarkdown_notes.html}{papers}, \href{https://stirlingcodingclub.github.io/Manuscripts_in_Rmarkdown/presentation.pdf}{slides}, and \href{https://bradduthie.shinyapps.io/gmse_gui/}{apps} in Rmarkdown \pause
\item Get a job \pause
\item \textbf{Write your own solutions to data management problems}
\item \textbf{Write your own statistical analyses}
\item \textbf{Create your own plots} \pause
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}

\textbf{A lot of coding is Googling solutions to get the code to work.}

# Write your own solutions to data organisation problems

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr);
tom <- read.csv("Tom_data.csv", header = TRUE);
print(tom);
```

\begin{small}
\textbf{Calc. the cumul\_mn for the BAI col. every year for each tree}$^1$: \pause
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Do not include \textit{current} BAI record in cumul\_mn calc
\item If the \texttt{Year SPEI} is >1 or -1, never include the BAI value
\item If the \texttt{Year - 1 SPEI} is  >1 or <-1, never include the BAI value
\item If the \texttt{Year - 2 SPEI} is  >1.5 or <-1.5, never include the BAI value
\item If the \texttt{Year - 3 SPEI} is  >2 or <-2, never include the BAI value
\end{itemize}
\end{small}

\footnotetext[1]{Thanks to \href{http://forest-ecology.com/about/}{Tom Ovenden} for letting me use this example.}

# Write your own solutions to data organisation problems

\textbf{Solution took 65 lines of code written in 3 custom functions.}

\vspace{2mm}

```{r}
tree_cumulative_mean <- function(dat){
    trees     <- unique(dat$Tree_ID);
    new_table <- NULL;
    for(tree in trees){
        sub_dat    <- dat[dat$Tree_ID == tree,];
        tree_cumul <- get_cumulative(tree = sub_dat);
        new_tree   <- update_cumul(tree = sub_dat,  
                                   vec  = tree_cumul);
        new_table  <- rbind(new_table, new_tree);
    }
    return(new_table);
}
```

The above is the 'outermost' function.

\item Wanted to make \href{https://github.com/bradduthie/Duthie_and_Nason_2016}{analysis open source} and figures reproducible \pause
\item Had to help a colleague use the same analysis on new data

# R is extremely useful for doing scientific research

\textbf{A bit of coding skill can save a lot of time in the long run.}

\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item You do not need to know everything
\item Help is available from many places
\item It might eventually become fun
